QuickSort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that sorts an array by recursively dividing it into smaller sub-arrays, sorting those sub-arrays, and then combining them back together. The algorithm works as follows:

Choose a pivot element from the array. This can be any element, but typically it is the first or last element in the array.
Partition the array around the pivot element, such that all elements less than the pivot are moved to the left of the pivot, and all elements greater than or equal to the pivot are moved to the right of the pivot. This creates two sub-arrays.
Recursively sort the sub-arrays created in step 2 using the same process until each sub-array contains zero or one element.
Combine the sorted sub-arrays back together to form the final sorted array.
In the implementation I provided, step 1 chooses the pivot as the middle element of the array, and step 2 partitions the array by iterating over each element and pushing it into one of two new arrays (less and greater) depending on whether it is less than or greater than the pivot. Steps 3 and 4 are performed by recursively calling quickSort on the less and greater sub-arrays and then combining them together with the pivot using the spread operator (...).

QuickSort has an average time complexity of O(n*log(n)) for sorting an array of n elements, making it one of the most efficient sorting algorithms available. However, its worst-case time complexity is O(n^2) if the pivot element is always the minimum or maximum element in the array, which can occur if the input array is already sorted or nearly sorted. To avoid this worst-case scenario, various strategies for choosing the pivot element have been developed, such as choosing a random pivot element or selecting the median of three randomly chosen elements.

function quickSort(arr) {
  if (arr.length <= 1) {
    return arr;
  }
  
  const pivotIndex = Math.floor(arr.length / 2);
  const pivot = arr[pivotIndex];
  const less = [];
  const greater = [];
  
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (i === pivotIndex) {
      continue;
    }
    if (arr[i] < pivot) {
      less.push(arr[i]);
    } else {
      greater.push(arr[i]);
    }
  }
  
  return [...quickSort(less), pivot, ...quickSort(greater)];
}

const arr = [5, 3, 8, 4, 2, 7, 1, 6];
const sortedArr = quickSort(arr);
console.log(sortedArr); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
